# Seattle Parks Complete

I had a goal of visiting every park in Seattle but I had no good way of
tracking them and the official [City of Seattle Parks Department
site](https://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks) was not very
user-friendly which lead me to create this site. I'm just using a [Leaflet map layer](https://leafletjs.com/) and [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to keep track of individual parks visited. The basic framework of this site could easily be transformed into other location based checklists such as libraries, baseball stadiums, etc.
